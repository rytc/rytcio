  SuNodeKu was our second group project for Full Stack boot camp. This project was about utilizing a MySQL backend to create an API. It is a Sudoku game
  that uses RESTful API to play Sudoku as well as provide leaderboard statistics. My main contribution was writing a compressor/decompressor for the game data 
  when storing the data in MySQL. This was done because Heroku's free-tier MySQL database has limited space.
