  SuNodeKu was our second group project for Full Stack boot camp. This project was about utilizing a MySQL database to create a RESTful API. It is a Sudoku game
  that uses API calls to play Sudoku, features leaderboards and a forum to ask for help on puzzles. My main contribution was the Sudoku game.
