  Ludum Dare 48 game jam entry, where the goal is to make a game from scratch in 48 hours. The theme of the jam was "despair", 
  and the game is a futuristic dystopia in the theme of Dune/Cyberpunk. It is a simple platform game that I made that mostly focused 
  on getting the feel/environment right.
