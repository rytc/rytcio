  Pet Rescue Finder was our first group project for the Full Stack Development bootcamp intended to develop a site that consumes RESTful APIs. My main contribution was creating
  a wrapper for Petfinder.com API to handle OAuth authentication and handle expiring keys. The wrapper provided a simple 
  function call to interact with the API on the front end.
