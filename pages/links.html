<p>Here is a curation of links and resources that I find interesting or valuable about various topics.</p>

<h2>Talks</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">Preventing the Collapse of Civilization</a> DevGAMM / Jonathan Blow (Thekla, Inc) (2019) - One of my favorite talks by Jon where he discusses 
    how societies can collapse through the loss of technological knowledge through generations and how that relates to software. This talk is where I found my goal and motivation as a software developer.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZRE7HIO3vk">The Thirty Million Line Problem</a> Casey Muratori (Molly Rocket) (2018) - Casey discusses how computer hardware is at its historical best
    while software is at its historical worst. Improvements in computer hardware performance won't make software faster due to how most software is built.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4">The Mess We're In</a> Strange Loop Conference / Joe Armstrong (2014)</li>
