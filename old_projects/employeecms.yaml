  This is a small CLI CRUD program done for homework. It is 
  an employee management program that allows for viewing, creation,
  update, and deletion of Departments, Roles, and Employees. The main
  point of this project was to practice complex SQL queries and using a 
  promise-based design to handle menues and database queries.
